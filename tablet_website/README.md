#HTML

We have different HTML files for different pages on the tablet. 
Tablet.html is the main page that has a start and stop button. 
When start is pressed ModeOption.html opens and you can choose 2 option.
MQTT is imported with javascript and sends the inputs to pepper. Then it runs the python codes that are connected to the different options.
